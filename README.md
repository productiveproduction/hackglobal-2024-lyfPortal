## Overview
lyfPortal enables you to be virtually “teleported” back to your memory capsules captured during your trip. Memory capsules include:
- lyf spaces & community events
- City attractions & important moments experienced by residents

These are **interactive 3D memory capsules** constructed using a **hotorealistic AI-trained photogrammetry** technique.

This project is built upon the previous 24 hours hacksingapore 2024 project. The previous project scope included construction and rendering of 3D photorealistic scenes, and geo-tagging these scenes to a location.

New features in lyfPortal include:
- Animations
- Injection of custom objects & textures into the 3D scene
- Collision surfaces
- Physics (gravity, force, friction, & velocity)
- Gameplay control

## User Experience
From a user perspective, lyfPortal enables residents to:
- Interact with their own memories
- Share memories with friends/on social media

### Community Benefits
This helps lyf build community in the following ways:
- **Strengthen community**: Increases resident satisfaction, loyalty, and retention, enhancing the lyf brand experience.
- **Grow community size**: Attract more people to join the lyf community and increase brand awareness.

## Corporate Benefits
From lyf's corporate standpoint, digitizing lyf spaces & events provides several benefits:
- **Potential revenue for 3D asset monetization**: Licensing 3D scenes & plug-and-play interactive modules for commerce, virtual event hosting, video games, etc.
- **Enhance attractiveness in partnerships and sponsorships**: Themed parties, sponsored interactive content, and more.
